I have two siblings, a brother and a sister.My sister is five years older than me, while my brother is fifteen months younger. <br> Some of my interest are mission work, drawing, writing, and reading. I heartily dislike math. <br> My major is Middle School Education, with an emphasis on Social Studies and English.</p> <br> This is a link to one of my favorite websites:
